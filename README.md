# CAMEL99
Camel Forth for the TI-99
This code requires the XFC99 cross compiler that runs in DOSBOX or on MS DOS or compatible OSes.

The Forth system that is created is 99% true to the original Camel Forth by Brad Rodriguez but it has a few optimizations to better handle the low speed of the TI-99 computer.
