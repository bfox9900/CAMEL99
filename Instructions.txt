How to Use XFC99.EXE

XFC99.EXE is an MS DOS application and as such will not run under Windows 8 or 10.
It may work ok under Windows 7 but has not been tested.
It was developed in DOSBOX on Windows 10.

XFC99 is a cross-compiler for Forth written in Forth.It accepts a command string from
the command line to get started and after that it operates very much like a Forth system since it is one.

This little tutorial will not give you everything you need to know and the documentation for
the cross-compiler is under development, however the source file "CAMEL99.HSF" gives you
pretty complete examples of how it works.

The file 9900FAST.HSF shows you how to use the CROSS-ASSEMBLER.

Source code for the system is in the COMPILER directory. You need HSF2012 to re-build it and I am not able
to release that at this time since it was a commercial Forth system albeit, from another era.

XFC99 Commands
-------------

Name Space Control
------------------
XFC99 makes use of the Forth VOCABULARY system allowing a set of name spaces to be searched 
in various orders.  Commands have been created to set the name space order for different
types of jobs that we need to do. Below are the Name space control commands:


CROSS-ASSEMBLING  
----------------------------
  sets the name space to XASSEMBLER and then CROSS-COMPILER word set.
  It is used when we want to write CODE words in Forth style TMS9900 assembler.
  The assembler is similar to the TI Assembler syntax but it is RPN of course.
  See 9900FAST.hsf for examples of how it works.
  

TARGET-COMPILING
-----------------------------
  TARGET-COMPILING tells the system to compile FORTH words into the [TARGET] memory segment.
  There is a short-form for this command called [TC]

  TARGET-COMPILING sets the 1st name space to a vocabulary called MIRROR.

  Words in MIRROR name space have exactly the same names as words created in the TARGET memory
  image of the program we are creating but they are used by the CROSS-COMPILER.  The words in the
  MIRROR vocabulary that are VARIABLES or CONSTANTS can be executed from inside the XFC99 system
  like Forth words. MIRROR Variables return their address in the TARGET memory address ie: the address
  they will give you when the program is running on the TI-99.

  MIRROR CONSTANTS will return the value they are set to so you can verify they are correct while
  debugging.



CROSS-COMPILING
----------------------------
  sets the 1st name space to CROSS-COMPILER, then TARGET words then XASSEMBLER
  There is a short form for this command called [CC]

  CROSS-COMPILING contains words that are FORTH "compiling" words.  To keep the author sane
  these "COMPILING" words are re-name with a leading "T".  So the Forth word S" is TS"
  
 COMPILE becomes TCOMPILE
 LITERAL becomes TLITERAL
 
 You can find examples of these words in the source code. 
 (This is my first cross-compiler so be a little merciful) 

  CROSS-COMPILING also provides you with some utility words like HEX and DECIMAL so you can 
  change number bases while debugging.  
  
  You also have access to handy utilities.
  WORDS, DUMPL and TSEE.
  
============================
CROSS-COMPILING UTILITIES
----------------------------

WORDS is the standard Forth command that lets you see the words in current vocabulary.

XFC99 WORDS can take a string parameter and will find all the words that contain that
string.

Example:  WORDS !  <enter>

          Will find the words ! V!  C! BASE! etc...

If you type:  MIRROR WORDS <enter>
              You will see all the words in the mirror name space.

If you type  CROSS-COMPILING WORDS <enter>
             You will see all the CROSS-COMPILER name space words.


DUMPL
-------------------------
DUMPL is like normal FORTH DUMP word but it needs one extra parameter.
The INTEL segment is needed to tell DUMPL (dump long) the full address.

The segment where the target program is created is called [TARGET]

Use DUMPL like this:

HEX [TARGET] A000 400 DUMPL <enter>

and you will see  1024 ($400) bytes in the target memory image starting at hex A000.


TSEE, the decompiler
-------------------------
It is possible to decompile the code you create from withing the XFC99 system by typing

TSEE <forthword>

Where <FORTHWORD> is valid word in the TARGET forth that you have compiled into memory.


Directory Location
------------------
XFC99 does not care where you place it in the DOS path.
IT DOES cares about 1 directory name.  LIB
In the directory where XFC99 resides there can be a directory called \LIB.
If you place files in \LIB they will be found by XFC99 without you explicitly
defining the path.

Example:

Let's assume XCF99.EXE is in the path C:\COMPILERS\XFC\

If you were to place the statement INCLUDE MYSTUFF.FTH in a source file, XFC99 will look
in it's current director (XFC)  and if not found, it will look for XFC\LIB\MYSTUFF.FTH.
That's as fancy as it gets.

You may prefer to simply put the entire path in your include statements.


BUILDING CAMEL99
-------------------
To build the binary image file called CAMEL99 do the following

CD to the directory where XFC and the source files are located.

At the DOS command line type:

XFC99 fload CAMLEL99.HSF <enter>

You will then see a long list of text telling you what is loading.


SOME CONFIGURATION REQUIRED
----------------------

Please look at the end of file CAMEL99.HSF

You will find this line of code.

      // copy CAMEL99 cc9900\clssic99\dsk2\

If you want to have XFC99 copy your finish CAMEL99 somewhere you can
do it with this line.

//  is the command to shell to DOS. Follow it with 1 space minimum and
then add your legal DOS commands.


TO BYE OR NOT TO BYE
---------------------
Also notice that the BYE command is commented out.
If you want to exit XFC99 after the build is completed simply remove the
backslash on that line.


HOW TO EXIT XFC99
------------------
If the process stops you will be inside the XFC99 Forth system.
You can snoop around from there and dump and/or dissaemble the code
up to the point that it errored out.

OR to exit XFC99 simply type BYE <enter>

and you will be back at the DOS command line.
